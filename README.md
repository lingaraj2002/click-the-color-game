## Overview

-- Click the Color is a simple, interactive, and fun web browser game designed to test your reflexes and color recognition skills. The goal is to click on the correct color as quickly as possible based on the displayed name of a color, while the background might distract you with other colorful choices.

## Features

--Interactive Buttons:

Each color button lights up when hovered over and provides a click effect when pressed.
A sound plays when a button is clicked, adding another layer of feedback.

--Responsive Design:

On mobile devices, the game grid adjusts from a 3x3 layout to a 2x3 layout for better usability.
The text size adapts for readability on smaller screens.

--Dynamic Animations:

When a correct button is clicked, the button briefly scales up and flashes green.
For wrong answers, the button shakes and turns red before returning to its original state.
The timer bar smoothly decreases over time, giving a visual cue about remaining time.
